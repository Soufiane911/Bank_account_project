Challenge - Bank Account
Objectives
Model a bank account to improve your OOP skills.

Guidelines
Write a class Account :
the account has some data, typically the name of the account holder, the account_number, and the current balance (2000 by default).
Three things we can do with an account is withdraw money, deposit money into the account, and dump (print out) the data of the account.

Instanciate two accounts for Ross and Rachel with random account numbers. Deposit and withdraw some money a couple of times. Then dump the informations on both accounts. The output should look like this:
ross_account.dump()
Ross, 9502018482, 1350
rachel_account.dump()
Rachel, 1945729572, 3450


Try now to instanciate directly bank accounts from your iPython console and play with them. Hint: you may have to use an import while being in the appropriate folder.

Your program must be written in bank_account.py.
